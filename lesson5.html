        <section>
            <h2>What are Chords?</h2>
            <p>A <strong>chord</strong> is a group of notes played together. The simplest chords are triads, consisting of three notes: root, third, and fifth.</p>

            <h2>Types of Triads</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Major Triad:</strong> Root, major third, perfect fifth (e.g., C-E-G).</li>
                <li><strong>Minor Triad:</strong> Root, minor third, perfect fifth (e.g., C-Eb-G).</li>
                <li><strong>Diminished Triad:</strong> Root, minor third, diminished fifth (e.g., C-Eb-Gb).</li>
                <li><strong>Augmented Triad:</strong> Root, major third, augmented fifth (e.g., C-E-G#).</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Chord Progressions</h2>
            <p>Chord progressions are sequences of chords that create a sense of movement in music. Here are some common progressions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>I-IV-V-I:</strong> Widely used in pop and classical music.</li>
                <li><strong>ii-V-I:</strong> A staple in jazz music.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Exercises</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Play the major and minor triads starting from C, D, and G.</li>
                <li>Write a simple chord progression using the I-IV-V-I pattern.</li>
