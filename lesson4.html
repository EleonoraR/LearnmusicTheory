    <h1>Lesson 4: Scales and Modes</h1>
    <p>Scales are the foundation of music, providing the notes that form melodies and harmonies. Modes are variations of scales that add unique flavors to your music.</p>

    <h2>What is a Scale?</h2>
    <p>A scale is a set of notes ordered by pitch. The most common type of scale is the diatonic scale, which has seven notes per octave.</p>
    
    <h3>Major Scale Formula</h3>
    <p>The major scale is defined by this sequence of whole (W) and half (H) steps:</p>
    <p><strong>W-W-H-W-W-W-H</strong></p>
    <p>Example: C Major Scale (C, D, E, F, G, A, B)</p>

    <h3>Minor Scale Formula</h3>
    <p>The natural minor scale follows this sequence:</p>
    <p><strong>W-H-W-W-H-W-W</strong></p>
    <p>Example: A Minor Scale (A, B, C, D, E, F, G)</p>

    <h2>Introduction to Modes</h2>
    <p>Modes are scales derived from the major scale, starting on different degrees. There are seven modes:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Ionian:</strong> Same as the major scale (C to C in C Major)</li>
      <li><strong>Dorian:</strong> Starts on the 2nd degree (D to D in C Major)</li>
      <li><strong>Phrygian:</strong> Starts on the 3rd degree (E to E in C Major)</li>
      <li><strong>Lydian:</strong> Starts on the 4th degree (F to F in C Major)</li>
      <li><strong>Mixolydian:</strong> Starts on the 5th degree (G to G in C Major)</li>
      <li><strong>Aeolian:</strong> Same as the natural minor scale (A to A in C Major)</li>
      <li><strong>Locrian:</strong> Starts on the 7th degree (B to B in C Major)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Practical Example: Dorian Mode</h3>
    <p>If you play the C Major scale but start and end on D, you are playing the Dorian mode (D, E, F, G, A, B, C).</p>
    <p>It has a jazzy and slightly mysterious sound compared to the major scale.</p>

    <h2>Why Learn Scales and Modes?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Understand the building blocks of melodies and harmonies.</li>
      <li>Explore different musical styles and genres.</li>
      <li>Improvise and compose music with a broader palette of sounds.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Practice playing scales and modes on your instrument. Start with the major scale, then experiment with different modes to hear their unique flavors!</p>
