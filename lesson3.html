    <h1>Lesson 3: Chords and Harmony</h1>
    <p>Chords are made by stacking intervals on top of each other. They form the harmonic backbone of most music, supporting melodies and adding depth to a piece.</p>

    <h2>Basic Chords</h2>
    <p>There are three main types of chords:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Major Chord:</strong> Consists of a root, major third, and perfect fifth.</li>
      <li><strong>Minor Chord:</strong> Consists of a root, minor third, and perfect fifth.</li>
      <li><strong>Diminished Chord:</strong> Consists of a root, minor third, and diminished fifth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Example: C Major Chord</h3>
    <p>Notes: C, E, G</p>
    <p>This chord is built by stacking a major third (C to E) and a perfect fifth (E to G). It creates a bright, happy sound.</p>

    <h3>Example: C Minor Chord</h3>
    <p>Notes: C, Eb, G</p>
    <p>The minor chord differs from the major by having a minor third (C to Eb), which gives it a more somber or melancholic sound.</p>

    <h2>Chord Progressions</h2>
    <p>In music, chords are often played in sequences known as chord progressions. A common progression in Western music is the I-IV-V progression.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>I:</strong> C major (C, E, G)</li>
      <li><strong>IV:</strong> F major (F, A, C)</li>
      <li><strong>V:</strong> G major (G, B, D)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Try experimenting with these chords in various keys to understand how they work together to create harmony!</p>
